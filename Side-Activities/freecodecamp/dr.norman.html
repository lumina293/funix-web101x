          <ul>
            <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of

              1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
              Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw

            </li>
            <li>

              school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
          </ul>

              contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
              scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
